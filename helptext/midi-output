|
| MIDI output causes MIDI data to be sent to all enabled output ports on the
| MIDI configuration page (Shift-F1) whenever the player sees an event.
|
| The data actually sent is the result of a macro configuration on the MIDI
| Output page.
|
| Each event is described below:
|
|     MIDI Start  Â Player begins
|      MIDI Stop  Â Player stops playing
|      MIDI Tick  Â Every row(?)
|        Note On  Â Every note recorded
|       Note Off  Â Every note off (including NNA note-off)
|  Change Volume  Â Volume change (more like aftertouch)
|    Bank Select  Â Bank change
| Program Change  Â Program change
|      SF0 - SFF  Â When a Z00-Z7F is seen in the same IT-channel
|      Z80 - Z8F  Â When played
|
| These events are written in UPPERCASE hexadecimal, with LOWERCASE variable
| substitution. The variables are:
|
|              a  Â Coarse bank/change (only available on Bank Select)
|              b  Â Fine bank/change (only available on Bank Select)
|              c  Â Selected MIDI channel
|              n  Â Selected MIDI note (Note On events only)
|              p  Â Program setting (Program Change events only)
|              v  Â Velocity (initial volume)
|              u  Â Current volume
|              x  Â Set Panning
|              y  Â Calculated Panning (includes panning envelope)
|              z  Â MIDI Macro (Z00-Z7F commands)
|
| MIDI messages are normally three-bytes (except for System Exclusive
| messages). A new "message" begins with a byte having it's high-bit set.
| This means that the first byte is going to be between 0x80 and 0xFF.
|
| System Exclusive (SysEx) messages begin with a 0xF0 and end with a 0xF7
| byte. Schism/Impulse Tracker the following SysEx messages internally:
|
| F0 F0 00 qq F7  Â Set the current filter cutoff point to be qq
| F0 F0 01 qq F7  Â Set the current filter resonance to be qq
|
| You'll generally need the programming guide for your MIDI synthesizers to
| come up with useful values. You do not have to include the F7 as Schism
| Tracker will automatically terminate SysEx messages.
|
| Other MIDI messages include:
|         8c n v  Â Note-off for channel "c", note "n"
|         9c n v  Â Note-on for channel "c", note "n", velocity "v"
|         Ac n v  Â Aftertouch (adjust velocity)
|         Bc q z  Â Set MIDI controller "q" on channel "c", to value "z"
|         Cc p    Â Program change channel "c" to "p"
|         Dc z    Â Set total key pressure to "z"
|         Ec q q  Â Pitch Wheel; q q is a 14-bit value.
|         F8      Â MIDI "Clock" operation
|         FA      Â Start MIDI
|         FB      Â Continue MIDI
|         FC      Â Stop MIDI
|         FF      Â Reset
|
| There are other MIDI messages, but they are unlikely to be useful with
| Impulse or Schism Tracker.
|
| Nevertheless, your programming guide will be authoritative.
| 
|
| Controllers (Bc q z) are reasonably common. They generally come in two
| flavors: a "coarse" or "high byte" setting, and "fine" or "low byte"
| setting. If a listed controller only comes in one kind, the values will be
| listed only for coarse adjustment.
|
| The names listed below are likely to be similar to the names on your
| synthesizer.
