Large swaths of code by Mrs. Brisby <mrs.brisby@nimh.org> <http://nimh.org/>
and Paper <paper@paper.us.eu.org>.

Based (obviously) on Impulse Tracker by Jeffrey Lim <jeff@lim.com.au>.

Default fonts created with ITF by ZaStaR <zastar@uclink4.berkeley.edu>.

Default palette settings are mostly from Impulse Tracker.
- "Atlantic" is from an ooooold version of IT.
- "Purple Motion" was roughly copied from an Imago Orpheus palette.
- "Why Colors?" is loosely based on the like-named FT2 palette.
- "Industrial" was created by Storlek.
- "Kawaii" was co-designed by Storlek and mml.
- "FX 2.0" was supplied by Virt.

Tim Douglas <timdoug@users.sourceforge.net> maintained the original Mac OS X
packages, and supplied patches fixing a handful of endianness issues.

The Schism Tracker logo was designed by delt.

The player engine was originally based on Modplug, which was written by
Olivier Lapicque <olivierl@jps.net>, with additional programming by Markus
Fick <webmaster@mark-f.de> (spline mixing, fir-resampler) and Adam Goode
<adam@evdebs.org> (endian-ness and char fixes).

Further changes to the player code were back-ported from the OpenMPT project
<http://modplug.sourceforge.net/>.

Ben de Graaff rewrote a large portion of libmodplug in C.

Some file-loading mechanisms, in particular large portions of the IMF loader,
as well as many of the tracker-identifying heuristics, have been adapted from
xmp by Claudio Matsuoka and Hipolito Carraro Jr <http://xmp.sf.net/>.

Tremor logic, and possibly some other effect handling, stolen from DUMB by Ben
Davis, Robert J Ohannessian and Julien Cugniere <http://dumb.sf.net/>.

IMF note slide effect processing taken from Imago Orpheus by Lutz Röder
(and then rewritten in C).

Other portions of file loading and playing code has been liberally adapted
from Mikmod by Raphael Assenat and Miodrag Vallat.

Joel Yliluoma (Bisqwit) implemented Adlib support and Scream Tracker sample
loading, and also contributed some MIDI-related code.

fmopl (OPL2-emulator used in Dosbox and MAME) was written by Jarek Burczynski.

Predefined Adlib MIDI patches taken from dro2midi, originally extracted from
Creative Labs' MIDI player (PLAY.EXE).

Some (small) portions of code have been borrowed from Cheesetracker, written
by Juan Linietsky <coding@reduz.com.ar>.

Various Amiga OS fixes by Juha Niemimäki <jniemima@mail.student.oulu.fi>.

Win32 Mixer by Gargaj/CNS <gargaj@conspiracy.hu>.

Michael Chen improved the software scaler quite a bit.
<zenki@users.sourceforge.net>

Some little fixes by ToastyX <toastyx@toastyx.net>.

Wii ISFS filesystem support code from ftpii by Joseph Jordan
<joe.ftpii@psychlaw.com.au>.

Wii Homebrew Browser icon by pbsds.

Path manipulation code taken from bash.

RepellantMold <repellantmold@outlook.com> improved the .stm loader and
created the .stx loader.

cs127 <cs127.pr@gmail.com> provided additional fixes to the .stm loader and
effect processing code.

HanaMcHanaface contributed fixes for backtabbing (Shift-Tab) and improvements
to the palettes page.

Vito Caputo <vcaputo@pengaru.com> provided the beginnings of the port to SDL2
and provided many additional improvements in the general codebase.
