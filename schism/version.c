		least I don't think they're ever localized, which would make it much more annoying.
		Should always exist, especially considering that we require gcc/clang. However, it is a
		poor indicator of the age of the *code*, since it depends on the clock of the computer
		that's building the code, and also there is the possibility that someone was hanging
		onto the code for a really long time before building it.

Lower 12 bits of the CWTV field in IT and S3M files.

"Proper" version numbers went the way of the dodo, but we can't really fit an eight-digit date stamp directly
into a twelve-bit number. Since anything < 0x50 already carries meaning (even though most of them weren't
used), we have 0xfff - 0x50 = 4015 possible values. By encoding the date as an offset from a rather arbitrarily
chosen epoch, there can be plenty of room for the foreseeable future.

  < 0x020: a proper version (files saved by such versions are likely very rare)
  = 0x020: any version between the 0.2a release (2005-04-29?) and 2007-04-17
  = 0x050: anywhere from 2007-04-17 to 2009-10-31 (version was updated to 0x050 in hg changeset 2f6bd40c0b79)
  > 0x050: the number of days since 2009-10-31, for example:
	0x051 = (0x051 - 0x050) + 2009-10-31 = 2009-11-01
	0x052 = (0x052 - 0x050) + 2009-10-31 = 2009-11-02
	0x14f = (0x14f - 0x050) + 2009-10-31 = 2010-07-13
	0xffe = (0xfff - 0x050) + 2009-10-31 = 2020-10-27
  = 0xfff: a non-value indicating a date after 2020-10-27. in this case, the full version number is stored in a reserved header field.
		   this field follows the same format, using the same epoch, but without adding 0x50. */
