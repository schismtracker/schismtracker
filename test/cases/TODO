* Video blitters need to be tested (make sure they don't write
  out of bounds). We should also be testing that they don't ever
  read from the buffer.
* Everything in modplug needs to be tested.
    * ALL of the format loaders need to be tested. in particular
      though, we have to make sure that we never ever crash if
      we receive a bad file.
