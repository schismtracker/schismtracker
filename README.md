# Schism Tracker

Schism Tracker is a free and open-source reimplementation of [Impulse
Tracker](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/wiki/Impulse-Tracker),
a program used to create high quality music without the requirements of
specialized, expensive equipment, and with a unique "finger feel" that is
difficult to replicate in part. The player is based on a highly modified
version of the [Modplug](https://openmpt.org/legacy_software) engine, with a
number of bugfixes and changes to [improve IT
playback](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/wiki/Player-abuse-tests).

Where Impulse Tracker was limited to i386-based systems running MS-DOS, Schism
Tracker runs on almost any platform that [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org/)
supports, and has been successfully built for Linux, Mac OS X, Windows,
FreeBSD, AmigaOS, BeOS, and even [the
Wii](http://www.wiibrew.org/wiki/Schism_Tracker). Schism will most likely build
on *any* architecture supported by GCC4 (e.g. alpha, m68k, arm, etc.) but it
will probably not be as well-optimized on many systems.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/wiki) for more
information.
