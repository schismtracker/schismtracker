/* This file is used for file format tables, load ordering, and declarations. It is intended to be included
after defining macros for handling the various file types listed here, and as such, it is not #ifdef guarded.

The type list should be arranged so that the types with the most specific checks are first, and the vaguest
ones are down at the bottom. This is to ensure that some lousy type doesn't "steal" files of a different type.
For example, if IT came before S3M, any S3M file starting with "IMPM" (which is unlikely, but possible, and
in fact quite easy to do) would be picked up by the IT check. In fact, Impulse Tracker itself has this problem.

Also, a format that might need to do a lot of work to tell if a file is of the right type (i.e. the MDL format
practically requires reading through the entire file to find the title block) should be down farther on the
list for performance purposes.

Don't rearrange the formats that are already here unless you have a VERY good reason to do so. I spent a good
3-4 hours reading all the format specifications, testing files, checking notes, and trying to break the
program by giving it weird files, and I'm pretty sure that this ordering won't fail unless you really try
doing weird stuff like hacking the files, but then you're just asking for trouble. ;) */

/* 669 has lots of checks to compensate for a really crappy 2-byte magic. (It's even a common English word
ffs... "if"?!) Still, it's better than STM. The only reason this is first is because the position of the
SCRM magic lies within the 669 message field, and the 669 check is much more complex (and thus more likely
to be right). */

as plain ProTracker, but are quite different; there are some really nasty heuristics to detect these... ugh,
ugh, ugh. However, it has to be above the formats with the magic at the beginning...
